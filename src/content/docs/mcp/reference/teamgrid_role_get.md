`teamgrid_role_get` is a read-only TeamGrid MCP tool. It is introduced by the
`full` profile and is advertised in: `full`, `admin-write`.

Get a workspace role

## Input schema

**Unpublished candidate:** this is the exact JSON Schema advertised by `@teamgrid/mcp-server@1.2.2`:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": {
      "maxLength": 128,
      "minLength": 1,
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "id"
  ],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The schema above is for `full`. Properties not in the selected profile schema are rejected.



## Scope and API operation

Required scope: `roles:read`.

- [`getRole`](/api/v1/reference/operations/getrole/) — `GET /roles/{id}`

The credential must also satisfy normal workspace authorization and any service-account resource
grants. Selecting an MCP tool profile never adds scopes to a credential.

## Output and limits

The bounded API result is returned as MCP structured content and equivalent JSON text. This tool returns a single API response envelope and is not paginated. The serialized result may not exceed
256 KiB.

The linked API operation is the canonical reference for the response envelope and resource schema.
Write tools preserve their declared revision/idempotency contract and require current permissions.
Accepted jobs provide status/resume information; uncertain writes must not be replayed blindly.

## Security classification

**operational-data:** The response contains operational workspace data visible to the credential.

The exact safety annotations are `{"readOnlyHint":true,"destructiveHint":false,"idempotentHint":true,"openWorldHint":false}`. The host and model can still retain tool
arguments and results in prompts, logs, or transcripts; use a dedicated least-privilege credential.

## Example prompt

> Read the TeamGrid role with ID `<id>` and summarize only the fields returned by TeamGrid.

The prompt is illustrative. Inspect the proposed tool arguments before approving access to
personal, commercial, conversation, or security-configuration data.

## Common failures

| Condition | Observable behavior and recovery |
| --- | --- |
| The host uses a tool profile that does not include `full` access. | The tool is not advertised to the host. Select the narrowest profile that contains it and restart the host. |
| `id` is missing or violates this tool’s exact input schema, including any pattern or length restriction. | MCP input validation rejects the call before an API request is made. |
| The credential lacks `roles:read` or cannot access the requested resource. | The tool preserves a safe API error code such as `insufficient_scope`, with redacted detail and available status/request metadata. |
| A read exceeds 256 KiB, or the connection ends while awaiting a write. | Use a bounded section, smaller supported read, private resource or authorized App/CLI transfer. |
| An unknown input property is supplied. | The strict input schema rejects the call before an API request is made. |

Authentication failures that prevent the MCP process from starting are covered separately in
